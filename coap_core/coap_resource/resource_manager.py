    The `ResourceManager` class manages CoAP resources within a CoAP core component.
    Usage:
    - Example usage might involve creating a single instance of the ResourceManager and adding resources to it.

    Notes:
    - Ensure proper initialization and handling of ResourceManager attributes before use.
    - Inherits from `CoapSingletonBase` to enforce a singleton pattern,
      allowing only one instance of ResourceManager.
    - The `discover_resources` method is currently a placeholder and needs
      to be implemented for actual resource discovery logic.
